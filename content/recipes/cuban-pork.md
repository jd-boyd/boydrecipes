- Originally from July/August '06 Cooks Illustrated, with additional notes.
- Brine:
- 6 cups water
- 3 cups sugar
- 2 cups table salt
- 2 garlic heads crushed
- 4 cups orange juice
- Take 7-8 pound picnic shoulder (our grocery store called it Pork
- of work scheduling, we previously did 12 and that also worked).
- Paste:
- 12 cloves garlic, chopped
- 2 tablespoons ground cumin
- 2 tablespoons dried oregano
- 1 tablespoon table salt
- 1.5 teaspoons black pepper
- 6 tablespoons orange juice
- 2 tablespoons white vinegar
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- pulses.
- Rinse pork, pat dry, the rub in paste, being sure to get it in the
- slits.  Refrigerate like that until ready to grill (I've always just
- grilled it immediately).
- Grilling:
- The meat needs to cook to 190.  That is about 6 hours on a gas grill on
- low.  An alternative recommendation was on a charcoal grill until it
- fell below 225 degrees, then in the oven at 325 degrees for another 2-3
- On the grills, heat one side of the grill, put the pork on the other
- the heat with aluminum foil for the first half of cooking, then remove
- for the second half.
- For any method, flip the meat about half way through the cooking.
- After cooking the meat, let rest for 1 hour.  Then, remove the skin in
- to be able to remove it so neatly), then slice against the grain into
- 1/4" slices.
- Drizzle mojo sauce over sliced pork just before serving.
- Mojo Sauce:
- I bought a bottle of Goya brand.  Below is a recipie for it that I
- haven't tried.  BTW, the store bought sauce also has lemon juice and no
- vinegar in it according to the ingrediants label.
- Make up to a day in advance.
- 4 medium garlic cloves, pressed or minced
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/4 cup distilled white vinegar
- 1/4 fresh orange juice
- 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper.
- Using the flat side of a chefs knife on a cutting board, drag the garlic
- and salt back and forth in a circular motion until they are ground to a
- until shimmering.  Add garlic past and cumin and cook, stirring, until
- fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Remove pan from heat and whisk in
- remaining ingrediants.  Transfer to bowl and cool to room temperature.
- Whisk to recombine before serving.
