- Heat broiler, with rack set 4 inches from heat source. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Squeeze spinach in a clean kitchen towel (or a double layer of paper towels) to remove as much liquid as possible. Combine spinach, parsley, cheese, capers, vinegar, garlic, and red-pepper flakes in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper; toss to combine.
- Cut several 12-inch pieces of kitchen twine; space evenly underneath steak. Spread spinach mixture down center of meat. Roll steak over mixture, pressing firmly to compact filling; tie twine to secure roll. Cut roll in half crosswise. Place halves, seam side down, on prepared baking sheet; rub with oil, dividing evenly, and season with salt and pepper.
