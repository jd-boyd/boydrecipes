- 1. Preheat the oven to 300ºF (150ºC).
- 1. Lightly butter a 9-inch loaf pan. Have a baking dish with high sides to make a water bath to bake the custard in.
- 1. To make the caramel, spread the 200g of sugar in an even layer in a skillet. Pour the water over it and add a few drops of lemon juice. Cook the sugar over medium-high heat until it reaches 245°F to 250°F.
- 1. When sugar is a deep amber color, remove from heat; pour the caramel into the buttered mold. Coat evenly. Set aside to cool. It will need to be under 120°F before the custard is added.
- 1. Whisk the eggs and sugar. Add vanilla. Gradually add the milk, whisking constantly.
- 1. Pour custard into the pan over the cooled caramel. Place flan in baking dish. Pour warm water into the outer dish, until it reaches over halfway up the outside flan.
- 1. Bake the uncovered flan in the oven 1 hour, 20 minutes, or until barely set.
- 1. Remove from the oven. Rest in the water bath for 30 more minutes.
- 1. Transfer the flan to a cooling rack. Let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until completely chilled, preferably overnight.
