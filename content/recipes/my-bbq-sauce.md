{{< recipe-ingredients >}}
- 8oz tomato sauce
- 2TB molasses
- 1TB honey
- 1TB vinager (apple)
- 1/4 cup jackie D.a
- 2 teasp. worchester sauce
- 1 teasp. liquid smoke (optional)
- 1 TB minced garlic.
- 1/4 large onion
- dash of pepper
- I left it above for proportion info).  Following will be some comments
- on it.
- I think another vineager might be more appropriate, but certainly not
- the other two I have on hand (balsamic and rice).  Further I'm thinking
- of scaling back the honey and molasses.  I used some honey to take the
- edge off the mollasses, but then the sum was sweeter than I wanted.
- It didn't taste right without the worchester sauce, but I don't know
- I think liquid smoke is OK when I'm cooking inside.  The first time I
- made it (the last recipe you likely have), I was broiling stuff in the
- oven, not cooking outside.
- More or less onion and garlic might be appropriate based on taste.
- Also, you might consider straining it out, or doing any number of other
- things to them for either flavor or consistency.  Most recent I minced
- together.  It ended up being two parts day old, 1 part fresh.

- This is a record of what I last did (except I didn't use liquid smoke.
- what to put in it's place.  A lot of people do use it.
- The sauce is better when it is a day+ old.  However, it was also
- acceptable fresh.  I made sauce on saturday and invited people for the
- next day.  The next day I invited more people, and realized I had an
- inadequate amount of sauce, and so made some fresh, and combined them
