- Roast turkey parts at 450°F for 45 minutes.
- De-glaze roasting pan with 1-2C water
- Place turkey parts, vegetables and herbs, de-glazing liquid and remaining 10-11C water into a stock pot (or dutch oven).
- Simmer for 4 hours.
- The goal is to reduce by one third to one half, but that can be hard to tell while in pot with solids.
- Remove easy to grip solids.
- Pour remainder through a fine mesh strainer into a new bowl.
- If more than 7 cups remain, place liquid back in pot to reduce down to around 6 cups.

{{< recipe-notes >}}
- Turkey stock is nice for making gravy.  The turkey parts can partially come from a turkey purchased for a meal, especially if you are spatch-cocking the turkey, but around Thanksgiving it is also often possible to buy some of those scrap parts separately from a bird at grocery stores.  I use the scraps I get from my turkey combined with some extra scraps or wings.
