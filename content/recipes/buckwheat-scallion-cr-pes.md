{{< recipe-ingredients >}}
- 1/2 cup buckwheat flour
- 1/2 cup AP flour

- Combine all the ingredients (except water) in bowl and whisk until smooth (as much as can be with scallion in it). Ideally let sit 2-24 hours, but it seems OK if you don't.
- Thin batter with water, adjust for desired consistency.
- Preheat pan over medium-high heat (about 350 deg). Lightly grease pan.
- Pour in enough batter to thinly coat the bottom of the pan. I like to use 1/4 - 1/2 cup measure. Swirl the pan to spread batter.
- Cook for 1 to 2 minutes on one side (on flipping should be golden and lift easily). The second side will probably require less time.
- The attached picture shows the crêpe with hoisin pork and carrots. I'm not happy with how I made those so they aren't included in the recipe.
- Also, you could use all buckwheat flour, but I thought the results were too dark when done that way.
