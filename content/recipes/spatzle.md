{{< recipe-ingredients >}}
- Initially from the Joy of Cooking.
- 1.5 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- pinch of ground nutmeg
- Beat together in a seperate bowl
- 2 large eggs
- 1/2 cup water or milk
- Bring 6 cups of salted water or broth to a boil.  In my opinion this
- Force the batter through a spatzle machine (or potato ricer) into
- boiling liquid.  Wait until all the bits float to the top, then remove
- with a strainer.
- Possible use:
- After 5+ minutes of drying, lightly fry in butter with a splash of mustard.

- Add to the flour mixture.  Beat with a wooden spoon.
- should be 4" of liquid rather than absolute measure.
- I then like to let a small amount at a time dry in a colander.
