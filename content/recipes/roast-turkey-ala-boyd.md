- This means use kitchen shears to remove the backbone by cutting
- through the ribs along each side. Then flip the bird and press on the
- breast to flatten it.
- Keep the scraps (neck, backbone, anything trimmed) for making gravy.
- I usually try to buy more turkey necks or wings to suplement, BTW.
- Pat turkey dry. Generously sprinkle the salt mixture on all surfaces. The turkey should be well coated but not encrusted.
- Place the turkey on a rack set in a half sheet pan and
- refrigerate, uncovered, for 12 to 24 hours, or loosly covered for up to 3 days.
- 1. Food process all ingredients.
- 1. Allow to warm to room temperature.
- 1. Rub under and over skin before roasting bird.
- 1. Pre-heat oven to 450 degrees F.
- 1. Spread carrots, celery, onions on bottom of roasting pan or baking sheet.
- 1. Place bird on top.
- 1. Toast until the breast is over 150 degrees F and the thighs are at
- least 165 degrees F. About 75-90 minutes for a 12-14 lbs bird.
- 1. If any part of the turkey is browning more than you like, put some foil over that portion.
- 1. Remove turkey from oven, cover with aluminum foil, and wait 20 minutes.
- 1. Carve and serve.
