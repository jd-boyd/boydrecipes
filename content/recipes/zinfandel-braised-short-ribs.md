- From http://www.poubelle.com/butterpig/archives/000149.html
- bone side down in a roasting pan 400 degree oven for about an hour, or until nicely browned
- remove pan from oven, ribs from pan, pour of all of the grease
- disorganized.  It tasted fine, but probably would have been better if
- I had.
- To re-heat/serve (Start at least an hour in advance, the reducing will
- take a long time).
- had maybe two cups remaining after reducing from a starting point of two
- bottles of wine)
- return ribs (still in their small pan, still covered) to a 350 degree oven to warm up

- The main courses were all nice and hearty dishes. The main meat was a slow braised short ribs over risotto.
- trim fat off the top, but leave on the bone, salt and pepper
- remove foil (careful!) and let ribs cool for a bit in the liquid
- remove ribs into a small pan and cover well with foil (at this point it was 4 o'clock or so, so we just left this covered pan out). They will most likely fall off the bone and this point, and that's fine.

- reduce liquid well until it starts to become a bit thick (I think we
