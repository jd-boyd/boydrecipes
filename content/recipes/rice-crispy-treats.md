{{< recipe-instructions >}}
- 1. Prepare a 9"x9" pan. Butter will work, but a parchment sling coated with butter will make removal even easier.
- 1. Melt butter over low in a pan that will be large enough to eventually add the rice crispies. A wok or a large metal mixing bowl may be ideal.
- 1. Let butter cool to 140°F.
- 1. Melt marshmallows into butter. This may require placing back on heat, but try to keep temperature around 140°F. Lower temperatures help prevent the treats being tough.
- 1. Add vanilla and salt.
- 1. Add rice crispies.
- 1. Move mixture into 9"x9" pan, and allow to cool.
