- 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
- 1. Separate egg whites from yolks.
- 1. Divide sugar in half. Set aside half.
- 1. Sift remaining sugar half with the salt the cake flour.
- 1. In mixer bowl, hand whisk egg whites, water, orange extract, and cream of tartar. After 2 minutes, switch to mixer. Slowly sift the reserved sugar into eggs mixture, beating continuously at medium speed, continue mixing until medium peaks form.
- 1. Once you have achieved medium peaks, remove bowl from mixer.
- 1. Sift enough of the flour mixture in to dust the top of the foam. Using a large spatula fold in gently. Continue until all of the flour mixture is incorporated.
- 1. Carefully spoon mixture into an un-greased tube pan. Bake for 35 minutes before checking doneness with a wooden skewer. (When inserted halfway between the inner and outer wall, the skewer should come out dry).
- 1. Cool upside down on cooling rack for at least an hour before removing from pan.

{{< recipe-notes >}}
- I use Domino brand super fine sugar. It can be bought at Walmart, online, or hopefully your local grocery store. I'm sure any brand is probably fine. Alternatively, stick sugar in food processor on high for 2 minutes, which is what Alton Brown recommends.
- It occurs to me that I should just try giving powdered sugar a go for this recipe. I will update it if I ever do.
