- From: http://chubbyhubby.net/recipes/the-addictive-soft-pretzel-roll/
- Sea salt (I used Maldon), poppy seed or sesame seeds
- The pretzel rolls are best eaten on the day itself. If you plan to eat them the next day, I would recommend that they be kept in the freezer. To reheat, thaw the roll completely. Preheat the oven to 180oC and bake 5-8 minutes.
- Beside sea salt, you can also sprinkle black pepper, sesame seeds, poppy seeds, parmesan cheese, or whatever you happen to have in your pantry.
